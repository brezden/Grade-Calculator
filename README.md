# Grade Calculator

This is a program that will calculate the final grades of students.

## Description

The use of this program is for a Teacher or Professor to input a class grading scheme
and be able to get the final grades for the list of students. It is a useful tool that 
does not take much time to use and can save many manual calculations.

## Getting Started

### Input file

To get the program to run you will need to use a Text File that will act as the main source for the input.
We have included a sample text file named "Class1" that will show how the file needs to be formatted.

### Saving the Grades.

Once you have completed entering your grades you will be asked if you will like the file to be saved. If you select 
"Yes" the file will save into the same folder that the code in stored in. This will contain all the grades you have
entered along side the names.
